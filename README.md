## Project 1 - Rain Particles ##
For the first project I wanted to focus on the Japanese anime story called “Weathering with you” which tells the story of a high-school boy who runs away to Tokyo and befriends an orphan girl who has the ability to manipulate the weather. In order to make money, they create a business where the girl gives people a moment of sunshine. Thinking about this concept, I want to create a project that connects the user to the weather. I want them to experience the changes and different moods rain can bring you. I knew from the very beginning, I wanted to incorporate rain and the atmospheric forces that make the weather and affect people.

## Concept  ##
My orginal idea was to create rain that drips down from a Japanese character. However, I decided to go with a more conceptual approach. The addon I included was ofxGui to complete this project.

## Ideal User ## 
My goal of the project is to highlight the emotions and impact weather can have on a viewer's mood.
